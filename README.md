# 🚗 Road Navigation  

Road navigation has gained significant attention in **real-time vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs)**. The primary focus of this project is to explore advanced techniques that can **enhance accuracy and efficiency** in existing road navigation algorithms. Various factors such as **noise, low visibility, and environmental conditions** can negatively impact the performance of current navigation methods.  

The methods developed so far have shown **efficient results in clear conditions**. However, they tend to fail or deliver **suboptimal performance** in the presence of noise or obstructions such as **fog, dust, shadows, puddles, oil stains, and tire skid marks** on the road.

## 🎯 Objectives  
✔ Improve the **reliability** of road navigation algorithms.  
✔ Develop **robust techniques** to handle noisy and obstructed road images.  
✔ Enhance **navigation accuracy** under adverse conditions such as fog and low visibility.

## ⚠ Challenges  
❌ Managing various types of **noise** affecting road images.  
❌ Ensuring **efficiency** in real-time scenarios.  
❌ Improving **detection** under poor visibility conditions.
